  version ("NUTS 60M")
  
• LAU (Local Administrative Units) — latest available version from 
  Eurostat/GISCO and associated copyright holders

These datasets are NOT licensed under this project's open-source software 
licence. They are redistributed (or referenced) under the terms specified by 
their original providers. All rights remain with Eurostat, GISCO, 
EuroGeographics, and any additional copyright holders.

2. Acknowledge the source exactly as required in the dataset metadata.

3. Indicate any modifications made to the data (e.g., re-indexing,
